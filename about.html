        My strengths as well as transferable skills include problem solving, critical thinking, adaptability and
        teamwork among others. As an individual I have demonstrated discipline since a very young age and was able to
        earn a tennis scholarship to attend college in this country, which allowed me to earn a Bachelor's degree in
        Biology. In my professional career I have earned multiple certifications, with my most proud accomplishment
        being the development and application of a critical care/ICU early mobilization program including therapists,
        physicians and multiple heads of departments in a level II trauma hospital.
        <br>
        Some of the things that I do as a hobby and as a coping mechanism to deal with the stress of daily life include;
    <ul>
        <li>Peloton</li>
        I have owned a Peloton bike+ for three years and I absolutely love it. Exercise is one of those things that
        keeps me somewhat sane. If you own any Peloton equipment, or use the app, feel free to add me, my username is
        PositiveCoping and my #MyCopingMechanism. I really enjoy the Peloton app because you can use any brand equipment
        to do their workouts. If you don’t own any equipment at all, they have a lot of workouts that are body weight
        based. I own the Peloton bike+ but also love to run, so I use my Gold’s gym treadmill to do their treadmill
        workouts while using the Peloton app on my TV.
       
        <li>Pickleball</li>
        OMG, I love Pickleball, and I know that a lot of tennis players dislike it, but let me tell you, I played tennis
        in college under a scholarship and again, OMG I love pickleball, I literally have no shame in the game lol. I
        played tennis almost on the daily since age eight until age 26 and because of it, I ended up being diagnosed with 
        degenerative bilateral medial meniscus tears at age 30, my running career was cut too soon as well, turns out running 
        five days a week for an entire year, exacerbated myalready degenerated knees, so, ENTER PICKLEBALL!!
    </ul>
