                I currently work as an Occupational therapist and have earned multiple certifications, with my most
                proud accomplishment
                being the development and application of a critical care/ICU early mobilization program, including
                therapists,
                nursing, physicians and multiple heads of departments in a level II trauma hospital.
            </li>
            <li>
                My education includes a Bachelor's in Biology, an Associate's and a Master's in Occupational Therapy
                with licensure.

            <li>
                I was born in Colombia and came to this country at the age of 15 with an athletic and academic
                scholarship to play tennis in college.

            Hobbies:
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Peloton</li>
            I have owned a Peloton bike+ for three years and I absolutely love it, I use the Peloton app anywhere
            between three to five days a week.
            <li>Pickleball</li>
            I played tennis almost daily since age eight until age 26. Unfortunately, at age 30, I was diagnosed with
            meniscus tears to both knees which kept me from playing tennis. The day I decided I was not able to continue
            playing tennis, I looked over and noticed the pickleball courts. The rest, is history.
            <li>Gaming</li>
            My favorite genres on the xbox, nintendo switch and mobile gaming include; adventure, first shooter,
            survival, sports, puzzles, online multiplayer, racing. I also enjoy board games, card games, charades,
            trivia.
